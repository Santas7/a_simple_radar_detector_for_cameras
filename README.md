# a_simple_radar_detector_for_cameras
Radar detector is a specialized radio receiver installed in the car and detects the work of police radar and warns the driver that the traffic police inspector is instrumentally monitoring the observance of traffic rules.

Load a video into the "video" folder and enter the path to the video (.mp4). 
```python
video_file = "video/video_reg.mp4"
```
Then run the program and watch how it works. If the program detects a camera, it will of course inform you about it.
